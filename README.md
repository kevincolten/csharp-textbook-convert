# Introduction 

C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a multi-purpose computer programming language suitable for all development needs.

## Introduction 

Although C# is derived from the C programming language, it has features such as garbage collection that allow beginners to become proficient in C# more quickly than in C or C++. Similar to Java, it is object-oriented, comes with an extensive class library, and supports exception handling, multiple types of polymorphism, and separation of interfaces from implementations. Those features, combined with its powerful development tools, multi-platform support, and generics, make C# a good choice for many types of software development projects: rapid application development projects, projects implemented by individuals or large or small teams, Internet applications, and projects with strict reliability requirements. Testing frameworks such as NUnit make C# amenable to test-driven development and thus a good language for use with Extreme Programming (XP). Its strong typing helps to prevent many programming errors that are common in weakly typed languages. Because of these similarities to other languages, it is possible to introduce C# as a language with features of C++ in addition to having the programming style of Java and the rapid application model of BASIC.[1]

A large part of the power of C# (as with other .NET languages), comes with the common .NET Framework API, which provides a large set of classes, including ones for encryption, TCP/IP socket programming, and graphics. Developers can thus write part of an application in C# and another part in another .NET language (e.g. VB.NET), keeping the tools, library, and object-oriented development model while only having to learn the new language syntax.

Because of the similarities between C# and the C family of languages, as well as Java, a developer with a background in object-oriented languages like C++ may find C# structure and syntax intuitive.

Microsoft, with Anders Hejlsberg as Chief Engineer, created C# as part of their .NET initiative and subsequently opened its specification via the ECMA. Thus, the language is open to implementation by other parties. Other implementations include Mono and DotGNU.

C# and other .NET languages rely on an implementation of the virtual machine specified in the Common Language Infrastructure, like Microsoft's Common Language Runtime (CLR). CLR, for example, manages memory, handles object references, and performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compiling of Common Intermediate Language code. The virtual machine makes C# programs safer than those that must manage their own memory and is one of the reasons .NET language code is referred to as managed code. More like Java than C and C++, C# discourages explicit use of pointers, which could otherwise allow software bugs to corrupt system memory and force the operating system to halt the program forcibly with nondescript error messages.

## History 

Microsoft's original plan was to create a rival to Java, named J++, but this was abandoned to create C#, codenamed "Cool".

Microsoft submitted C# to the ECMA standards group mid-2000.

C# 2.0 was released in late-2005 as part of Microsoft's development suite, Visual Studio 2005. The 2.0 version of C# includes such new features as generics, partial classes, and iterators.[2] [3]

To compile your first C# application, you will need a copy of a .NET Framework SDK installed on your PC.

There are two .NET frameworks available: Microsoft's and Mono's.

## Microsoft .NET 

For Windows, the .NET Framework SDK can be downloaded from Microsoft's .NET Framework Developer Center. If the default Windows directory (the directory where Windows or WinNT is installed) is C:\WINDOWS, the .Net Framework SDK installation places the Visual C# .NET compiler (csc) in the

C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.0.3705 directory for version 1.0, the

C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322 directory for version 1.1, the

C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727 directory for version 2.0, the

C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.0 directory for version 3.0, the

C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5 directory for version 3.5, or the

C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319 directory for version 4.0.

## Mono 

For Windows, Linux, or other Operating Systems, an installer can be downloaded from the Mono website. For Linux, one good compiler option is cscc, which can be downloaded for free from the DotGNU Portable.Net project page. The compiled programs can then be run with ilrun.

### Linux 

In Linux you can use the MonoDevelop IDE, and either download from their website at: MonoDevelop Downloads, or install via apt-get or your distro's installer.

*   Debian-based distros:

```
sudo apt-get install monodevelop
```

*   Arch Linux:

```
sudo pacman -S mono monodevelop
```

### Windows 

You can download MonoDevelop from their website at: Mono website. Click the Windows icon, and follow the installation instructions.

If you are working on Windows it is a good idea to add the path to the folders that contain cs.exe or mcs.exe to the Path environment variable so that you do not need to type the full path each time you want to compile.

For writing C#.NET code, there are plenty of editors that are available. It's entirely possible to write C#.NET programs with a simple text editor, but it should be noted that this requires you to compile the code yourself. Microsoft offers a wide range of code editing programs under the Visual Studio line that offer syntax highlighting as well as compiling and debugging capabilities. Currently C#.NET can be compiled in Visual Studio 2002 and 2003 (only supports the .NET Framework version 1.0 and 1.1) and Visual Studio 2005 (supports the .NET Framework 2.0 and earlier versions with some tweaking). Microsoft offers five Visual Studio editions, four of which are sold commercially. The Visual Studio C# Express Edition can be downloaded and used for free from Microsoft's website.

## Hello, World! 

The code below will demonstrate a C# program written in a simple text editor. Start by saving the following code to a text file called hello.cs:

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyConsoleApplication
{
	class MyFirstClass
	{
		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			System.Console.WriteLine("Hello,");
			Console.WriteLine("World!");
			Console.ReadLine();
		}
	}
}
```

To compile hello.cs, run the following from the command line:

*   For standard Microsoft installations of .NET 2.0, run `C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\csc.exe hello.cs`
*   For Mono run `mcs hello.cs`.
*   For users of cscc, compile with `cscc hello.cs -o hello.exe`.

Doing so will produce hello.exe. The following command will run hello.exe:

*   On Windows, use `hello.exe`.
*   On Linux, use `mono hello.exe` or `ilrun hello.exe`.

Alternatively, in Visual C# express, you could just hit F5 or the green play button to run the code. If you want to run without debugging, press CTRL-F5.

Running hello.exe will produce the following output:

```
Hello,
World!
```

The program will then wait for you to strike 'enter' before returning to the command prompt.

Note that the example above includes the System namespace via the using keyword. That inclusion allows direct references to any member of the System namespace without specifying its fully qualified name.

The first call to the WriteLine method of the Console class uses a fully qualified reference.

```csharp
System.Console.WriteLine("Hello,");
```

The second call to that method shortens the reference to the Console class by taking advantage of the fact that the System namespace is included (with using System).

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("World!");
```

C# is a fully object-oriented language. The following sections explain the syntax of the C# language as a beginner's course for programming in the language. Note that much of the power of the language comes from the classes provided with the .NET framework, which are not part of the C# language syntax per se.
